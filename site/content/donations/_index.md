      We are a local community charity, dedicated to helping the young people within the Borough of Islington, working with young people who may be at risk of falling into a lifestyle of knife crime, drugs and violence, creating opportunities to realise and fulfill their potential.

      We have been advocates for our children and teens with school, the police, and other authorities.  We meet with parents and their peers to help mediate conflicts, and accompany them to meetings or important appointments to provide support. If we feel their voices are not being heard, we speak up, and encourage them to do the same.

      Our team and volunteers build lasting, meaningful relationships with the young people who come to us. We let them be themselves and engage in positive activities designed to promote and stimulate healthy bodies and healthy minds.

      We need volunteers to help with face to face work with young people, mentors and volunteers to help with fundraising, publicity and marketing. We believe that volunteering is also another form of donation as this will benefit our community. If you are intrested in volunteering send us a message on our 'Contact Us' page.
