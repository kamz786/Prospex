     We aim to support the young people with whom we come into contact by building a safe environment that
     enables them to reach their full potential. Whether this means taking homeless teenagers on their first
     trip to see the ocean, or ensuring that the girls we work with are empowered and confident, we believe
     that every child deserves to live a life filled with fun and enriching experiences.

  heading: What we offer
  description: >-
    Young people want places to go. In Islington, they have a number of options, but few of them are free. Community centres in estates have been closed, or are being redeveloped. Many don’t feel safe travelling to the places which remain open because of high incidence of crime or antisocial behaviour. Prospex gives them somewhere to learn, play, or just relax – closer to home.
  plans:

      items:
        - Problem - Islington lacks interesting, engaging, open, free spaces for young people to spend their
          time outside. In certain instances, young people become entrenched in gang culture and unwilling to
          move into new, unfamiliar spaces because of shyness, wariness, or safety issues.
        - What we offer - Our Street Teams exist to make sure young people are safe and well, wherever they are.
          If they’d rather not come to the centre, our staff check in on them in their local area. This builds a
          mutual trust and allows positive relationships to be formed.
        - Sollution - Our joint Street Team’s work has reduced antisocial behavior and the criminalisation of
          young people in the geographical areas we cover. Whilst that is the main focus of our outreach
          programme, we have also helped young people back into work, education and apprenticeships.

    - description:
      items:
        - Problem - Many schools do not have the resources to offer learning mentors or individual support for
          young people. Often, neither do their parents. Growing up is hard enough; if they see their families
          struggling and their own prospects feel bleak, it is even harder.
        - What we offer - We allocate young people a dedicated One2One worker based on their needs and
          circumstances. Our One2one work could range from a few sessions helping a young person complete an
          application form, to many years working with them and their families.
        - Sollution - Through regular one-to-one sessions with their personal worker, young people have a
          constant in their life – someone who will listen to them, encourage them, raise their aspirations and
          give them the confidence to overcome what is holding them back from reaching their potential.

      programmeName: 'One 2 One'
    - description:
      items:
        - Problem - For most of the children who use our centre they have neither the life skills needed to
          thrive as adults, nor the adequate space within which to learn them. This can include the basic skills
          such as using a computer for younger children, confidence for girls and the ability to cook.
        - What we offer - Our Centre is open for young people aged 8 to 24. Three times a week we not only
          teach the young people how to make a nutritious meal, but we also encourage them to sit and enjoy their
          dinner together. Once a week, we offer an empowerment session for girl.
        - Sollution - Each year, we provide over 4000 meals to Islington’s children and 1800 hours of free
          child care to the parents whose children use our service. For many of our parents, the existence of
          Prospex’s centre based work is the difference between being able to work and having to stay at home.
